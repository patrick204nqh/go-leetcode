# Go LeetCode

Welcome to the `go-leetcode` repository! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems written in Go. Each problem is organized into a directory following a consistent naming convention for easy navigation and management.

## Directory Structure

```bash
go-leetcode/
â”œâ”€â”€ algorithms/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1-two-sum/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main_test.go
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ generate.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/patrick204nqh/go-leetcode.git
cd go-leetcode
```

### Generate a New Problem Directory

To generate a new problem directory, use the `generate` target in the `Makefile`:

```sh
make generate 1 two-sum
```

This will create a new directory `algorithms/1-two-sum` with `main.go` and `main_test.go` files pre-populated with boilerplate code.

### Running a Problem

To run a specific problem's main file, use the `run` target in the `Makefile`:

```sh
make run algorithms/1-two-sum
```

### Testing a Problem

To run tests for a specific problem, use the `test` target in the `Makefile`:

```sh
make test algorithms/1-two-sum
```

### Adding More Test Cases

You can add more test cases in the `main_test.go` file under the `testCases` array. Each test case is a struct containing the input and the expected output.
